          <p id="tribute-info">Sam Bourne is the literary pseudonym of Jonathan Freedland, an award-winning British journalist and broadcaster.
             He has written a weekly column for the British newspaper The Guardian since 1997, having previously served as the paper’s Washington correspondent.
              His work has also appeared in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Newsweek, The New Republic, the Evening Standard, and The Jewish Chronicle, and he has presented BBC Radio 4’s contemporary history series “The Long View.”<br>
               For nearly two decades, he has covered the Middle East conflict, and in 2002, he chaired a three-day dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, sponsored by The Guardian. The participants in that meeting went on to broker the 2003 Geneva Accords.
                He has also written two non-fiction works, Jacob’s Gift and Bring Home the Revolution. He lives in London with his wife and two children<a target="_blank" id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Freedland">Go to Wiki</a></h3></p>
